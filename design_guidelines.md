# Design Guidelines Not Applicable

This project is a **backend API service** with no frontend or user interface components. It consists of:

- Node.js/Express server
- REST API endpoints (/health and /generate-video)
- JSON responses only
- Headless service for n8n integration

## No Visual Design Required

Since this is a pure backend service without any UI, visual design guidelines are not applicable. The project has:

- **No web pages** to design
- **No user-facing interface**
- **No visual components**
- **No frontend framework**

The only "output" is JSON data returned from API endpoints, which follows a programmatic structure rather than visual design principles.

**If you need a frontend dashboard or admin panel** to interact with this backend API, please submit a separate request specifying:
- What functionality the UI should have (create videos, view status, manage queue, etc.)
- Whether it's an admin dashboard, public interface, or both
- Any specific aesthetic preferences

That would require a completely separate frontend application with its own design guidelines.
